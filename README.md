final project for cs61b which aims to generate a 2D game from scratch colleberated with my classmate and housemate Max Bravo. I guess the instructer intended to ask students to 
apply Percolation algorithm which is related to random alogrithm but we found it is quite tedious to do so and we are not rabbit kids who follow every instruction step by step. 
Thus we came up with the idea of combining partitions and random walk together for our own alogrithm which makes tiles generations at least two times faster with better sparcity.

Please let us know if you end up making any improvement for this.
Here is the video for detailed description.

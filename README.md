final project for cs61b 'Build your own world', which aims to generate a 2D game from scratch, colleberated with my classmate and housemate Max Bravo. I guess the instructer intended to ask students to 
apply Percolation algorithm (suggested running time O(n²)) which is related to random alogrithm but we found it is quite tedious to do. 
Thus we came up with the idea of combining partitions and random walk together for our own alogrithm which makes tiles generationsfaster with better sparcity(suggested running time O(n)).

Please let us know if you end up making any improvement for this.
Here is the video for a detailed walkthrough.
